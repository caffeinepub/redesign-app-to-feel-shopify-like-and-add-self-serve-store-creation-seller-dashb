  "summary": "REQ-24 and REQ-25 appear implemented via an authenticated `/` redirect in `RootLayout`, with onboarding redirect target taking precedence and a redirect/loading state to prevent the landing page from flashing. One unrelated utility change (`urlParams.ts`) appears to introduce extra functionality not requested.",

    {
      "description": "Expanded/added URL parameter + sessionStorage utilities (e.g., persisted URL params, hash query parsing, clearing hash params) unrelated to authenticated-home redirect or onboarding redirect precedence.",
      "reason": "BuildRequest only asks for `/` redirect behavior and ensuring onboardingStorage redirect precedence; URL param persistence/management is not mentioned.",
