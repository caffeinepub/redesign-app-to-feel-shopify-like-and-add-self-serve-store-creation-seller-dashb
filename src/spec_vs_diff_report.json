  "summary": "The diff implements the requested Seller Dashboard redesign with a dashboard-only dark top bar, onboarding/checklist-style cards wired to existing actions, and preserves product management access. No clear evidence of 'Shopify' text remains in the new dashboard components. The diff also includes unrelated global styling and URL-parameter utility changes that were not explicitly requested for this dashboard-only redesign.",
