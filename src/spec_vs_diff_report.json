  "summary": "Diff shows changes to backend/main.mo and new/expanded frontend query hooks and URL param utilities, plus updates to a frontend file summary and project_state.json. The BuildRequest (REQ-33) is about minimally fixing build/deploy failures without touching immutable frontend paths; the diff does not provide clear evidence that the specific build/deploy failure was identified and resolved, and it appears to introduce unrelated UI/product work.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-33",
      "requirement": "Investigate the current build/deployment failure, identify the root cause, and implement the minimal code/configuration changes required so the project builds and deploys successfully again (backend Motoko + frontend React/TS), deploys without traps, and core routes render without a blank screen.",
      "reason": "The diff summary shows substantial code additions/changes but does not include any explicit build/deployment configuration changes or evidence (e.g., fixing a specific compilation/type error, canister install/upgrade trap, or routing blank-screen issue). From the provided truncated snippets, it is not possible to confirm that the build now compiles cleanly, deploys successfully, and that / and /seller-dashboard render correctly.",

      "reason": "REQ-33 does not request new data-layer features; only minimal changes to restore build/deploy. The diff indicates broad functional surface area changes beyond a targeted fix.",

      "reason": "Explicitly outside scope per BuildRequest non-goals (no new product features/UI redesign/additional pages unrelated to unblocking build/deploy). While the actual code for these files is not shown as modified in the diff list, the modified frontend-file-summaries.txt asserts these changes as part of the work.",
