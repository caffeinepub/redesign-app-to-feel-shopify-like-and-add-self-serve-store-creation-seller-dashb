  "summary": "Diff implements major parts of the seller onboarding flow and seller dashboard UI, updates global theme tokens to an emerald-neutral palette, adds supplier->products navigation via URL filtering, and adds asset path constants and logo usage in the header. However, the required generated image files themselves are not evidenced in the diff, and some added features (admin seeding button, Stripe setup modal, placeholder migration) are not part of the BuildRequest.",
