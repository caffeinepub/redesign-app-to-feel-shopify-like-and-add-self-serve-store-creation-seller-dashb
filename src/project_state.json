  "architectural_notes": [
    "Platform goal: Shopify-like multi-store e-commerce with role-based access (seller/dropshipper) and storefront + checkout.",
    "Avoid third-party/trademarked branding in UI text; use platform brand name 'Shanju' across landing/marketing surfaces.",
    "Routing rule: if user is authenticated (already logged in), visiting / should redirect to the dashboard (landing page is only for unauthenticated users).",
    "Seller dashboard redesign should follow the provided Shopify-style screenshot closely but must use 'Shanju' branding anywhere a Shopify name would appear; slight layout variation is acceptable.",
    "Store creation/onboarding should be one-time per authenticated Internet Identity principal; if a supplier profile/store already exists for the logged-in user, the app should not prompt or force the Create Store flow again and should route the user directly to the Seller Dashboard."

  "known_issues": [
    "'Start free trial' on the landing page does not actually onboard/authenticate users (no magic link/password/OTP is sent and users cannot reach the dashboard).",
    "After completing free-trial login, returning users still see the landing page; requirement is to route authenticated users directly to the dashboard on repeat visits.",
    "Seller Dashboard redesign is still not matching the provided Shopify-style screenshot/layout closely enough (user feedback: 'সেইম হয়নি' / 'not the same').",
    "Three-dot (ellipsis) menu in the Seller Dashboard/top bar is not updated to match the provided screenshot; user requests all related options/settings be aligned to the screenshot.",
    "Create Store flow/page is being shown repeatedly even after the user is logged in and has already created/linked a store; the store should remain associated with the same login and not require re-creation.",
    "UI/layout elements become jumbled/overlap ('সব একসাতে এলোমেলো হয়ে যায়') and need spacing/alignment adjustments (likely responsive layout issue).",
    "Three-dot (overflow) menu dropdown/options background should be white (improve menu readability/visual match to screenshot)."
